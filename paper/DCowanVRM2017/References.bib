abstract = {The results of investigations of the superparamagnetic (SPM) effect, which takes place with the transient electromagnetic method (TEM) process, are discussed. Depending on the objective of the investigations, the SPM-effect can be considered either as a disturbance or as a useful tool. In this paper we consider some ways of suppressing SPM noise when conventional TEM investigations are carried out, and the application of SPM for mineral deposits exploration. Such an application is based on specific properties of subsurface rocks and soil samples above gold and nickel deposits. It is shown, that anomalies with relaxation time constants of SPM-processes are spatially correlated with the ore deposits. The nature of the anomalies can be connected with the presence of a mixture of elements in ferromagnetic minerals producing an SPM-effect. It is proposed that these elements have been brought to the surface by upgoing gas flows from the deep-lying ore-containing bodies and are characteristic in tectonic fault zones. The spatial peculiarities and supposed mechanism of their formation give us a possibility to use them as a tool for exploration of certain types of mineral deposits, such as those of gold and nickel.},

Measurements of magnetic susceptibility of material separated magnetically from soil samples taken at areas where a residual response is measured. show that over a wide temperature range (from - 196°C to 590°C) the susceptibility increases with temperature, confirming the presence of superparamagnetic particles. The anomalous transient response is localized to within 3 m of the transmitter loop; it is consequently detected only by loop configurations where the receiver loop is in proximity to the transmitter loop.

abstract = {Detection of buried unexploded ordnance (UXO) requires application of geophysical methods that exploit contrasts in magnetic susceptibility and/or electrical conductivity of the UXO relative to surrounding soil and rock (the geologic background). At many sites, the contrasts are very large, and the detection capability is relatively independent of the geologic background. Some sites, however, are predictably problematic, such as volcanic terrains (e.g., Maui and Kaho'olawe, HI, USA). Other sites that would not intuitively be predicted to pose detection problems are found to have localized high susceptibility zones with wavelengths and magnitudes that can significantly complicate UXO detection. Details of a site in Indiana (USA) are presented that illustrate order of magnitude variation of magnetic susceptibility over distances of 2–3 m. Magnetic susceptibility at the site correlates to topography and soil type. Magnetic power spectral density plots from magnetic surveys at selected areas at the Indiana site are compared to each other and to data from Maui, HI, and demonstrate the key issues in UXO detection with magnetometry. Magnetic susceptibility data from Kaho'olawe are used to illustrate the effects on electromagnetic induction surveys for UXO detection and discrimination. The phenomenological observations suggest approaches for magnetic and electromagnetic induction survey data processing to enhance anomaly detectability and model-based inversion.}

abstract = {We try in this paper to characterize the magnetic behaviour of soils both in the frequency and time domain. Our aim is to understand the anomalous responses we have observed in many EM surveys. A wide range of soil samples have been analysed with two instruments specially designed for harmonic (80 Hz-10 kHz) and transient (8-100-mu-s after cut-off) EM low inducing fields (50-mu-T). The most common spectrum observed could be explained with the well-dispersed single-domain grain theory (SD): a logarithmic decrease of the in-phase susceptibility with frequency and a constant quadrature susceptibility. Moreover, measurements in the frequency domain of the quadrature susceptibility and measurements of the coefficient of viscosity in the time domain have been compared and found to be in good accordance with theory. But other types of magnetic spectrum were encountered and could not be accounted for SD theories. This results in a non-logarithmic dependence of the in-phase susceptibility, a non-constant quadrature susceptibility and in the time domain a coefficient of viscosity S which is time dependent. It is demonstrated that the response due to quadrature magnetic susceptibility in the frequency domain and the magnetic viscosity in the time domain is sufficiently strong to be responsible for the anomalous responses. It is now possible to correct in an EM survey for the soil magnetic effect for a better determination of resistivity or conductivity.},

abstract = { This paper presents an analysis, based on existing work in geophysics and nondestructive testing, of the effects of soil electromagnetic properties on the functioning of metal detectors widely used to detect buried landmines. The host soil is modeled as a half-space having real and frequency-independent electrical conductivity but frequency-dependent complex magnetic susceptibility. The analysis technique has been applied to three examples of soil of practical importance, namely, nonconducting soil with frequency-independent susceptibility, nonconducting soil with frequency-dependent susceptibility, and nonmagnetic soil with constant conductivity. Simplifications are made to clearly explain a number of previous field and experimental observations, for example, the greater influence of magnetic properties than of electrical conductivity on the performance of metal detectors. Results also show that soil magnetic properties affect continuous wave and pulsed-induction detectors differently. The effect that electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility of the host soil have on the signal produced by a target is investigated by computing the response of a buried small metallic sphere. Computations show that in some cases, which could represent practical landmine detection scenarios, the signal from the soil can dominate that due to the target, making it hard to detect the target. Further, it is shown that magnetic soil can alter a target's spectral response, which implies that, contrary to present practice, object identification techniques should take into account the electromagnetic parameters of the host medium.},

abstract = {A general model to compute the response of an electromagnetic induction sensor to a magnetic soil, in both time and frequency domains, is developed. The model requires modest computational resources and can be applied to arbitrary soil inhomogeneities and relief, and to arbitrary sensor coil shapes, orientations, and positions. Central to the model is the concept of a head sensitivity map, which can be used to characterize the sensor head as a function of the shape, size, and position of the sensor coils. Two further concepts related to the head sensitivity are presented, which are the zero equisensitivity surface and the volume of influence. We demonstrate that these concepts aid the understanding of the detector behavior. The general model is based on the Born approximation, which is valid if the soil magnetic susceptibility is sufficiently small. A simpler model, which is only valid for homogeneous half-space soils but does not require the Born approximation, is also developed. The responses predicted by both models are shown to be in good agreement with each other and also with available analytic solutions. Comparing the two models also enabled an expression for the error incurred when using the Born approximation to be established. We shown that, for most soils of relevance to mine clearance, the corresponding error is negligible.},

Here we report on the effect that two distribution functions, namely the magnetic analogues of the Cole-Cole and Frohlich distribution functions, have on the after-effect function of three ferrofluid samples. The samples chosen were those for which good alternating current susceptibility data, X'(omega) and K''(omega), were available, namely in the lower frequency range in which the frequency of the maximum of X''(omega), f(max) is indicative of the presence of aggregates. However, because of a lack of knowledge of the sizes of these aggregates it was not possible to generate a distribution function. By fitting the Cole-Core and Frohlich distribution functions to the susceptibility data it is shown that the after-effect function is very sensitive to the distribution used, illustrating the difficulty of determining accurate after-effect functions without an adequate knowledge of the distribution function. it is shown that, in all cases, the use of the Frohlich distribution function results in a decay function with the fastest initial rate of decay.},

abstract = {Ungrounded horizontal loop transient responses of uniform conductive and magnetically viscous earth have been simulated using two different codes. One algorithm employs the relationship between viscous magnetization and the magnetic flux it induces in the receiver loop. In the other algorithm, the Helmholtz equation in a boundary-value problem is solved using the Fourier transform with frequency-dependent magnetic permeability. The two solutions are identical for noncoincident loops but differ when the transmitter and receiver loops are closely spaced (at 1 cm or less). In the latter case correct results are provided by the first code. The magnetic relaxation and eddy current responses appear to be independent at conductivities typical of the real subsurface. Therefore, TEM responses of magnetically viscous conductors can be computed using the superposition principle. Although transients change in an intricate way as a function of loop geometry and earth parameters, these changes exhibit certain patterns which may be useful at the stages of exploration and TEM data processing. In configurations where the receiver loop is laid outside the transmitter, the interaction of magnetic relaxation and eddy current decay causes sign reversal in transients. This reversal occurs at late times after an earlier sign reversal due uniquely to eddy current. ?? 2008.},

The earth region of interest is discretized into many prismatic cells, each with constant susceptibility. The resulting system of discrete equations is solved using an ILU-preconditioned Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized (BiCGStab) algorithm. Formulations for total and secondary field computations are developed and tested against analytic solutions and against a solution in the integral equation domain. The finite volume forward modelling method forms the foundation for a subsequent inversion algorithm. The underdetermined inverse problem is solved as an unconstrained optimization problem and an objective function composed of data misfit and a regularization term is minimized using a Gauss-Newton search. At each iteration, the CGLS algorithm is used to solve for the search direction. The inversion code is tested on synthetic data from both geometrically simple and complicated bodies and on field survey data collected over a planted ferrous shipping container.},

@article{Moskowitz1985,
abstract = {The magnetic viscosity of some oceanic basalts from IPOD site 417D is investigated. The samples are fine-grained pillow basalts and coarse-grained massive flows. Experiments on the viscous behaviour of these samples include (1) acquisition and decay of weak-field viscous remanent magnetization (VRM) and (2) the influence on VRM produced by the zero field storage time following demagnetization by an alternating magnetic field. In all cases the aquisition of VRM is found to be more rapid than its subsequent decay. The time dependence of the intensity of VRM is observed to be significantly non-logarithmic during acquisition, but less so during decay. The length of time a sample remains in zero field following demagnetization produces a decrease in the aquisition and decay coefficients of VRM. These results cannot be reconciled entirely with predictions based on existing models of magnetic viscosity due to thermal fluctuations. Available evidence also suggest that the effect on VRM produced by (1) zero field storage following demagnetization or produced by (2) different initial states of magnetization, is attributed to susceptibility disaccommodation. Unfortunately, the available data are insufficient fully to ascertain the importance of diffusion after-effect and disaccommodation to long-term viscous behaviour. It is suggested, however, that diffusional processes may contribute to VRM in young pillow basalts ({\textless} 0.1 Ma) near mid-ocean ridges where the oxidation of titanomagnetite produces an increase in the number of octahedral lattice site vacancies and the elevated temperature of the crust enhances the diffusive reordering of these vacancies and ferrous ions. In order to gain some additional insights into VRM and attempt to explain some of these observations, theoretical and experimental results pertaining to diffusion after-effect and disaccommodation in magnetic materials are reviewed.},

Simulations were performed using a two-dimensional bed (height 0.2 m, width 0.08 m) and 4000 particles. The particles used had a diameter of 1 mm and densities in the range 1590-2650 kg/m3. A carefully formulated strategy is presented for establishing the minimum fluidization and minimum bubbling velocities by DEM simulations. The influence of the magnitude of the cohesive interparticle force on fluidization characteristics is analysed in terms of the change in the ratio of the minimum bubbling to minimum fluidization velocities. Imposing a cohesive interparticle force on particles which are initially Geldart Group D or B is found to bring about Group A characteristics. Most notable of these characteristics is the existence of non-bubbling fluidization for a range of gas velocities between the minimum fluidization velocity and the minimum bubbling velocity.},

In particular, magnetic material affects the decay curve characteristics in electromag- netic surveys and this can adversely affect inversion calculations that try to estimate parameters of the UXOor determine whether the item is UXO or scrap. This talk focuses on the effects mag- netic soils and magnetic viscosity have on time domain and fre- quency domain electromagnetic sensor data. By forward modelling of a 1-D layered earth model we investigate the sensitivity of surveys to magnetic soils, and attempt to determine the rela- tive strengths of magnetic soils and buried metallic objects. In particular, we consider soil susceptibility models appropriate for Kaho'olawe Island, Hawaii, where the UXO clearance project hasbeen hampered by the presence of highly magnetic basaltic soils. Finally, we investigate how perturbations in signal due to magnetic soil affect the ability to recover parameters of the dipole model presented in Pasion and Oldenburg (2001a).},

abstract = {The presence of magnetic iron oxides in the soil can seriously hamper the performance of electromagnetic sensors for the detection of buried land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO). Previous work has shown that spatial variability in soil water content and texture affects the performance of ground penetrating radar and thermal sensors for land mine detection. In this paper we aim to study the spatial variability of iron oxides in tropical soils and the possible effect on electromagnetic induction sensors for buried low-metal land mine and UXO detection. We selected field sites in Panama, Hawaii, and Ghana. Along several horizontal transects in Panama and Hawaii we took closely spaced magnetic susceptibility readings using Bartington MS2D and MS2F sensors. In addition to the field measurements, we took soil samples from the selected sites for laboratory measurements of dual frequency magnetic susceptibility and textural characteristics of the material. The magnetic susceptibility values show a significant spatial variation in susceptibility and are comparable to values reported to hamper the operation of metal detectors in parts of Africa and Asia. The absolute values of susceptibility do not correlate with both frequency dependence and total iron content, which is an indication of the presence of different types of iron oxides in the studied material.},

abstract = {Magnetic characteristics of soils can have a profound influence on electromagnetic sensors for the detection of unexploded ordnance (UXO) and may cause false alarms in the case of spatially variable concentrations. In particular, the performance of several electromagnetic sensors is hampered by viscous remanent magnetism, which is caused by the presence of ferrimagnetic iron oxide minerals of different sizes and shapes. Tropical soils formed on basaltic substrates commonly have large concentrations of iron oxide minerals. To improve detection and discrimination of UXO in these soils it is crucial to have a better understanding of the types of minerals responsible for the magnetic behavior, as well as their distribution in space. In this paper we present the results of recent field and laboratory studies of soil magnetic properties and soil mineralogy at the former Naval training range on Kaho'olawe Island, Hawaii. We discuss the role of environmental controls such as parent material, age and precipitation on the magnetic properties.},

@article{Worm1998,
abstract = {Sediments and soils often contain superparamagnetic (SP) magnetite or maghemite grains that cause a frequency dependence of low-field susceptibility Xfd which does not exceed 15 per cent/decade of frequency. Present models predict very different volume distributions for samples with the largest observed frequency dependence of susceptibility. While Stephensons' (1971) power-law model predicts most grains to be smaller than the stable single domain (SSD) threshold, the phenomenological model of Dearing et al. (1996) suggests that most grains are between 10 and 25 nm in diameter. Finally, the recent calculations of Eyre (1997) indicate very broad volume distributions. This study reviews the nature of the superparamagnetic–stable single domain (SP–SSD) transition. The change of AC susceptibilities with grain size (or temperature) at the SP–SSD boundary is more gradual than commonly assumed. When distributions of particle coercivities and volumes are also considered, Xfd values are much smaller than those calculated by Eyre (1997). Nonetheless, Xfd can be larger than 15 per cent, and a larger frequency dependence has indeed been measured for some samples. The question whether the observed limited Xfd of soils and sediments is a result of a broad distribution or of a bimodal distribution, where SP and SSD grains are restricted to a certain relative abundance, can potentially be answered by susceptibility determinations at more than two frequencies and by measurements of the temperature dependence of susceptibility.},

abstract = {The influence of magnetic viscosity of geological media is a problem. Magnetic viscosity is caused by relaxation of magnetization of superparamagnetic grains presented in rocks. Very often the soil of Southern Africa is presented by laterites. The results of investigation of the superparamagnetic effect (SPM), which takes place with transient electromagnetic method (TEM) process, are discussed. The effect is modeled for coaxial-loop transient responses of magnetically viscous layer. The equations describing process of SPM effect allow mathematical modeling of field data. The TEM survey observed SPM effect on the several ore fields in Zimbabwe. Mathematical modeling allowed us to subtract process of SPM from field reading. The remain signals were distorted by electroosmosis IP effect. For each sounding the value of chargeability was determined. It was observed that all borehole reached chrome ore located on the areas of lower electroosmosis chargeability (less than 30{\%}). We propose that chargeability is a secondary effect of synclinal structures related to chrome dyke intrusion.},
